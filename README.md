## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project from GitHub to your local machine.
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name
````

### 2\. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

  - **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - **On macOS / Linux:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4\. Set Up Environment Variables

You need to provide your own Google Gemini API key.

1.  Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project folder.
2.  Add your API key to this file in the following format. **Do not** use quotes.
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YourSecretApiKeyGoesHere
    ```

### 5\. Run the Application

Start the Flask server. The application will initialize the database on the first run.

```bash
python app.py
```

Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
